# ContactForm
Contact Form/Privacy Policy

This code represents an HTML document that creates a landing page form for SantiClinic, a medical aesthetics clinic. The form allows users to enter their name, email, phone number, and message. Upon submitting the form, the data is sent to a Google Apps Script URL using the HTTP POST method.

The form includes validation for the name, email, and phone number fields, ensuring they are required before submission. After submitting the form, a success message is displayed, and the form is reset.

The page layout consists of two sections: the first section displays a Google Maps embedded iframe showing the location of SantiClinic, and the second section contains the form itself. The form is styled using CSS, with a primary and secondary color scheme defined. The form elements are positioned and styled accordingly.

The CSS code at the end defines the styling for the form and the page layout, including background colors, box shadows, font styles, input fields, buttons, and the privacy policy text.
